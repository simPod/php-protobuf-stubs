# Stubs for PHP Protobuf extension (3.6 version)

## Installation

Add package to your composer.json

```sh
composer require --dev simpod/php-rdkafka-stubs
```

## Usage

Once package is installed, your IDE should simply discover all stubs automatically. Please notice, that `simpod/php-protobuf-stubs`
package has no autoloader configuration provided, so stubs classes are visible in your IDE, but don't clashes with `protobuf`
extension namespaces.
